# Geo3D-Release
You need the following
- ReShade with addon support (http://reshade.me)
- Latest Geo3D release

http://flugan.net for general info.

You install reshade with addon support into the game of choice.
Install either by inspecton or trial and error the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Geo3D in the same folder as reshade.
Make sure the folder is the main exe folder
Unreal engine 4 execute from deep within the folder structure.
One sign is that the real exe is often large even though UE4 sometimes have a lonely large exe file in the root (ignore it).

By default settings like screen size in combination with separation is targeted at a big screen.
I currently recommen you keep it that way as it is more compatible with whatever your setup is.

Get used to Geo3D before attempting to change convergence as it is more complicated than what I desire.

flugan.net has a brief description about changing convergence.

Optonal software like
- VRScreenCap (https://github.com/artumino/VRScreenCap)

Can be nice
